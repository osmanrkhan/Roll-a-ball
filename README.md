# Roll-a-ball

Build for WIndows made with Unity 3D engine. The user controls a ball moving around on a flat plane. 
THe user has to pick up severa hovering, rotating cubes to win the game.
The movement of the user's ball as well as the cubes was all done with C#
Much of this was learnt from Unity's own tutorial,but I've made additions of my own.
PLEASE ENJOY!
